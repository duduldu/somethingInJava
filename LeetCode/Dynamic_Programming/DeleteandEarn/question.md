740. 删除并获得点数

给你一个整数数组nums，你可以对它进行一些操作。
每次操作中，选择任意一个nums[i]，删除它并获得nums[i]的点数。之后，你必须删除 所有 等于nums[i] - 1 和 nums[i] + 1的元素。
开始你拥有 0 个点数。返回你能通过这些操作获得的最大点数。

示例 1：
输入：nums = [3,4,2]
输出：6
解释：
删除 4 获得 4 个点数，因此 3 也被删除。
之后，删除 2 获得 2 个点数。总共获得 6 个点数。

示例2：
输入：nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
输出：9
解释：
删除 3 获得 3 个点数，接着要删除两个 2 和 4 。
之后，再次删除 3 获得 3 个点数，再次删除 3 获得 3 个点数。
总共获得 9 个点数。

提示：
    1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
    1 <= nums[i] <= 104

740. Delete and Earn

You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:
    Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
  You earn a total of 6 points.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
  You earn a total of 9 points.

Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
    1 <= nums[i] <= 104
